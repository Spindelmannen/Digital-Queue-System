# Digital-Queue-System
Inl√§mningsuppgift2_Jonathan_Adolfsson_Nackademin_Fend21_Javascript1

This task/homework was given to me from my Javascript Teacher, is about creating a simple queue system for an imaginary Airport by working with the DOM using javascript.

i've coded this with code that ive learned and understand so far. 

in this code you will find buttons that you actually can click on, with help of EventListerners the buttons do something.

i've commented every line of code (in swedish)

this code could always be better ofc.. but i got some other homework coming in hot! 

maybe one day ill improve this queue system, who knows!
